            " 1.1  In the first consultation paper arising out of our current project  – Renting Homes\n",
            "1: Status and Security, Consultation Paper 162 (henceforth “CP 162”)  – we set\n",
            "out our provisional proposals for the simplification of the law relating to the status\n",
            "and security of tenure of those with the right to occupy premises as a home, other\n",
            "than as freeholders or long leaseholders. At the heart of those proposals was the\n",
            "proposition that the granting of rights to occupy premises as a home should be\n",
            "seen primarily as a matter of contract between the parties. The terms of the\n",
            "contract would be shaped by principles of consumer law which would outlaw\n",
            "terms that were unfair.\n",
            " 1.2 We argued that this consumer approach would have two principal advantages:\n",
            " (1) The contract would contain a full statement of the legal rights and\n",
            "obligations of both landlords and occupiers under the occupation\n",
            "agreement. Particularly, if expressed in Plain English, we argued that this\n",
            "should assist both sides to the contract to understand their legal position\n",
            "more readily than they can at present.\n",
            " (2) This approach would be generally more suitable for this sector of the\n",
            "housing market. It would replace the complex and frequently\n",
            "incomprehensible combination of contract law, landlord and tenant (real\n",
            "property) law and statute law which had characterised the legal regulation\n",
            "of the rented sector of the housing market in the past.\n",
            "SCOPE OF OUR PROPOSALS\n",
            " 1.3 The scope of our proposals was deliberately set wide. We argued that it should\n",
            "cover the vast majority of arrangements whereby the right to occupy a home has\n",
            "been granted by a landlord to an occupier. In particular, it would cover\n",
            "arrangements which, under the present law, would be classified as licences as well\n",
            "as tenancies.\n",
            "Exclusions\n",
            " 1.4 We acknowledged that there would have to be exclusions from the proposed\n",
            "scheme. The letting of holiday homes or the grant of rights to occupy by a resident\n",
            "landlord were two such examples. Also excluded from our proposals were\n",
            "arrangements that did not relate to the renting  of homes  and which were, in any\n",
            "event, subject to other regulatory regimes. We did not, therefore, consider business\n",
            "tenancies, licensed premises and agricultural tenancies where alternative statutory\n",
            "schemes exist. It also excluded long leases (where we adopted, as a cut off point,\n",
            "leases in excess of 21 years) which amount, in economic and social terms, to a\n",
            "2form of owner occupation rather than a way of renting a home. Otherwise, we\n",
            "argued that there should be as few exceptions as possible.1\n",
            " 1.5 Our final recommendations on the scope of the scheme we propose will, of course,\n",
            "have to await our analysis of the responses to CP 162 and consideration thereof.\n",
            "THE SUBORDINATE NATURE OF THIS CONSULTATION PAPER\n",
            " 1.6 Despite its length, CP 162 was based on the straightforward assumption that there\n",

            " 3.3 At present, the rights of those who have entered agreements to share property are\n",
            "determined primarily by the principles of the law on joint tenancy and tenancy in\n",
            "common, found in land law. It is important to stress that these principles apply to\n",
            "all cases where there is co-ownership of land, not just to cases where land has been\n",

            " 3.4 While it is not necessary for the purposes of this paper to give a full account of this\n",

            " 3.5 First, an important distinction between joint tenancy and tenancy in common is\n",
            "that under joint tenancy a “right of survivorship” applies. This means that, on the\n",
            "death of one joint tenant, the survivor takes over the whole of interest in the\n",

            "property has been acquired on the basis of sharply different contributions this may\n",

            "leave his or her share by will to another.\n",

            "21 3.6 Secondly, another feature of joint tenancy (as opposed to tenancy in common)  is\n",
            "that liability to meet the obligations under the joint tenancy agreement is, unless\n",
            "there is any provision to the contrary, “joint and several”. This means that each\n",
            "tenant is liable to meet in full the obligations under the agreement. This is so even\n",
            "where one tenant who was supposed to contribute to meeting those obligations\n",
            "fails to make the proper contribution, for example to payment of the rent.2\n",

At the heart of those proposals was the\\nproposition that the granting of rights to occupy premises as a home should be\\nseen primarily as a matter of contract between the parties. The terms of the\\ncontract would be shaped by principles of consumer law which would outlaw\\nterms that were unfair.\\n 1.2 We argued that this consumer approach would have two principal advantages:\\n (1) The contract would contain a full statement of the legal rights and\\nobligations of both landlords and occupiers under the occupation' metadata={'source': 'new_articles\\\\Carr_law_commission_cp168.pdf', 'page': 6}\n",

We did not, therefore, consider business\\ntenancies, licensed premises and agricultural tenancies where alternative statutory\\nschemes exist.

Otherwise, we\\nargued that there should be as few exceptions as possible.1\\n 1.5 Our final recommendations on the scope of the scheme we propose will, of course,\\nhave to await our analysis of the responses to CP 162 and consideration thereof.\\nTHE SUBORDINATE NATURE OF THIS CONSULTATION PAPER\\n 1.6 Despite its length, CP 162 was based on the straightforward assumption that there\\nwould be a single landlord and a single occupier. It sought to set out proposals to\\nregulate the relationship between the landlord and occupier.\\n 1.7 In reality, people do not structure their lives in this simple and straightforward way.\\nThe situations in which occupation agreements are made will be much more\\nvaried and complex than this.

Alternatively, it may involve the new\\noccupier having no direct legal relationship with the landlord. This may happen,\\nfor example, where the occupier allows other people to live in the premises on a\\nnon-contractual basis or grants a sub-occupation agreement. To reflect this variety\\nof situations, our scheme needs detailed rules which determine how each of these\\ntransactions should be carried out, and what the position will be if it is not done\\ncorrectly.\\n 1.9 In legal terms, under our new scheme, persons who share accommodation may be\\nclassified as: co-occupiers (either contractual joint occupiers or non-contractual\\n1' metadata={'source': 'new_articles\\\\Carr_law_commission_cp168.pdf', 'page': 7}\n",

This\\napproach is consistent with the suggestion made in CP 162 that that distinction\\nshould not have a role as between the immediate landlord and occupier, but that\\nthe distinction would remain of importance in determining the scope of third party\\nrights and obligations. Our general approach is to propose that occupiers under\\nagreements which count as leases will have rights both against the new landlord\\nand against the world, whereas those under licences will not.

It examines the extent of the rights and liabilities of the new\\noccupier, both as against the other occupiers and as against the landlord.\\nIt then turns to consider the position of others in the occupier’s household\\nwho do not have a contractual relationship with either the occupier or the\\nlandlord.\\n (2) Lodgers . In many situations, an occupier may want to take another person\\nin to live in his or her home as a lodger.  In Part IV we examine the extent\\nto which occupiers should have the right to take in a lodger. We look at the\\nposition of the lodger as against the occupier and also as against the\\nlandlord.\\n (3) Sub-occupiers . Where an occupier does not wish to live in his home, or only\\nwishes to live in part of it, he or she may want to “sub-contract” their\\nrights of occupation to another.

We consider the extent to which landlords\\nshould be able to control this process. We ask what rights, if any, sub-\\noccupiers would have against the landlord, if requirements relating to the\\nobtaining of consent have not been complied with.\\n (4) Transfer . In Part VI we consider whether occupiers should be able to\\ntransfer (assign) their rights of occupation to another and, if they can,\\nwhat is the nature of the relationship between the new occupier and the' metadata={'source': 'new_articles\\\\Carr_law_commission_cp168.pdf', 'page': 9}\n",

Consideration is also given to the situation where a court\\norders an adjustment of occupation rights.\\n (5) Succession . Part VII considers the effect of the death of an occupier on the\\noccupation agreement and the extent to which occupiers should be free to\\npass the rights under their occupation agreement to others.\\n (6) Landlords’ successors in title . As mentioned above, Part VIII asks on what\\nbasis the law should decide what rights the occupier has against other\\nclasses of people. In particular, it considers what happens to the\\nrelationship between the landlord and the occupier when the landlord\\ntransfers their interest in the property to another.\\n 1.21 One of the issues that recurs throughout this paper is the extent to which a\\nlandlord should be able to control any transactions which an occupier may wish to' metadata={'source': 'new_articles\\\\Carr_law_commission_cp168.pdf', 'page': 10}\n",

This is so even\\nwhere one tenant who was supposed to contribute to meeting those obligations\\nfails to make the proper contribution, for example to payment of the rent.2\\n 3.7 Thirdly, the law relating to joint tenancy limits the number of persons to whom a\\nlegal joint tenancy can be granted to four.3\\n Any further joint tenants have only an\\nequitable interest in the property.

We need to determine the basis on which third parties should\\nbe bound by the rights and obligations which arise under occupation agreements\\ncreated by our scheme.\\n 8.6 The issue may be illustrated by considering the case where a landlord wishes to sell\\ntheir interest in a property to another. Historically landlords have been left largely\\nfree to deal with their property interests without any such dealing directly affecting\\ntenants. They can usually do what they want without their tenants’ consent.4\\n 8.7 Where the landlord either cannot obtain vacant possession prior to sale, or chooses\\nnot to do so, the buyer takes the property subject to any tenancies. The buyer\\nsimply becomes the new landlord under the original tenancy.\\n 8.8 Where property is only occupied under a licence, the position is different.

The \\nsuggested range of obligations followed what the Committee considered to be \\nnormal practice in increasing the landlord's degree of responsibility as the period \\nof the letting reduced.

An RRO \\nis a means for tenants and former tenants living in the private rented sector to reclaim a \\nmaximum of 12 months’  rent paid to a landlord.

            "page_content='8 \\n  \\nTIPS:  \\n \\n- Ask for application fees to be repaid by respondent at the hearing  \\n \\n- Check  who the real landlord of your property is/was. Often agents put themselves as a \\nlandlord on a tenancy agreement. Key to deciding who is the landlord is really the \"control\" \\nof the property: who is managing it and who receives the rent. Even though an agen t might \\nbe in this position it\\'s worth checking that they haven\\'t covered themselves with a clause on \\nlicensing, for example, in their contract with the head landlord: such clauses leave the \\nlicensing as the responsibility of the head landlord and so the h ead landlord needs to be \\nnamed as the respondent  \\n \\n- Go to a hearing before yours to see how things work: the public are allowed to attend.

This \\nhas always been the case in regard to succession to an assured housing association \\ntenancy.  \\nFor secure tenancies created before 1 April 2012, the right to succeed may , currently,  be \\nclaimed by a member of the deceased tenant’s family, subject to certain eligibility criteria .  \\nEven though a  member of the deceased tenant’s family m ay currently have a statutory \\nright to succeed to a  secure council tenancy, if they are under -occupying the property the' metadata={'source': 'new_articles\\\\SN01998.pdf', 'page': 2}\n",

Where landlords/agents invest in the standard of \\ndécor and physical fabric of their properties, this can facilitate the \\nhome-making process, generating positive health and wellbeing benefits \\nfor tenants (Garnham & Rolfe, 2019a ).

The Appellant’s argument is very simple. It is that sections  87 to 89 of the \\nAct constitute an exhaustive code governing the fate of  a secure periodic tenancy \\nupon the death of a tenant. The operati on of these provisions is mandatory and \\nautomatic, displacing the general law. Th e tenancy therefore vested automatically \\nin her under section 89 if four and only four conditions were satisfied, namely (i) \\nthat “a secure tenant”, i.e. Mrs. Hickin , had died; (ii) that the tenancy was a \\nperiodic tenancy; (iii) that the Appella nt occupied the house as her only or' metadata={'source': 'new_articles\\\\uksc-2010-0239-judgment.pdf', 'page': 7}\n",

There is no issue about conditions (ii), (iii) and (iv). They were all satisfied. \\nBut the Court of Appeal held  that condition (i) was not.  In my view, they were \\nright about this. \\n6. The relationship between Part IV of  the Housing Act and the common law \\nis not in doubt. A secure tenancy is not just  a personal right of oc cupation. It is an \\nestate in land whose incidents are defined by  the general law, save insofar as these \\nare modified by the Act. Subject to that  proviso, as Lord Ho ffmann pointed out in \\nBirmingham City Council v Walker  [2007] 2 AC 262 at [5], it can be “assigned,' metadata={'source': 'new_articles\\\\uksc-2010-0239-judgment.pdf', 'page': 7}\n",

Sections 87 to 89 \\nof the Act are part of a wider scheme contained in sections  8 7  t o  9 1 .  T h e s e  \\nprovisions extensively modify the genera l law which would ot herwise govern the \\ntransmission of a secure tenancy. Their ge neral scheme is that, subject to limited \\nexceptions (such as property adjustment  orders in matrimonial proceedings), a \\nsecure tenancy cannot be transmitted with the benefit of the statutory security of \\ntenure, whether inter vivos  or in the course of the administration of the tenant’s \\nestate, except to a person qualified to succeed under section 87.

Third, in a number of cases the Act does not \\nmodify the general law governing the tr ansmission of tenancies, but only the \\nstatutory security of tenure available wh ere the tenancy has been transferred. \\n8.

            "page_content='8. Against that background, the first ques tion to be addresse d is what is the \\nlegal basis on which Mr Hickin would be entitled to the tenancy apart from section \\n89 of the Act. This depend s on the legal incidents of  a joint tenancy at common \\nlaw. Upon the death of one of two pers ons holding under a joint tenancy, the \\ninterest of the deceased person is extingu ished. The survivor thereby becomes the \\nsole tenant. But there is no transmission of the tenancy. In Tennant v Hutton  (Court \\nof Appeal, 9 July 1996, unreported) , Mill ett LJ, delivering the judgment of the \\nCourt of Appeal, put th e point in this way: \\n“The essence of a joint tenancy is th at the property is vested in all or \\nboth of the joint tenants together. In contemplation of law there is only one tenant, though the tenant c onsists of two or more persons \\nand the survivors and survivor of them. On the death of any one of \\nthem, the property becomes vested in  survivors or survivor. There is' metadata={'source': 'new_articles\\\\uksc-2010-0239-judgment.pdf', 'page': 8}\n",

There is \\nno true transmission of title. The pr operty remains vested after the \\ndeath in the same tenant as it did before, though the number of \\npersons who compose the tenant is reduced by one.” \\nThe result, at common law, is this. By vi rtue of section 81 of the Housing Act, \\nboth Mr and Mrs Hickin were secure tenant s for as long as at least one of them \\noccupied the property as an only or prin cipal home. Upon Mrs Hickin’s death, the' metadata={'source': 'new_articles\\\\uksc-2010-0239-judgment.pdf', 'page': 8}\n",

He simply continued to enjoy the same rights as he had always  had, under \\nan agreement with the loca l authority landlord to which he was and remained \\nparty. The only change in his position was that there was no longer another person \\nconcurrently enjoying the same rights. A ccordingly, he became the sole tenant. \\nSince he was absent, there was now no one occupying the property as his or her \\nonly or principal home. The “tenant cond ition” in section 81 of the Act was \\ntherefore no longer satisfied, and the tenanc y while continuing to exist ceased to be \\nsecure. But because a tenancy may be a secure tenancy at any time when the \\nlandlord condition and the tena nt condition are satisfied (see section 79), it would \\nhave been open to Mr. Hickin to revive its secure status by returning to live in the \\nproperty at any time before the tenancy wa s terminated by serv ice of a notice to' metadata={'source': 'new_articles\\\\uksc-2010-0239-judgment.pdf', 'page': 9}\n",

The facts were  that a husband and \\nwife held the property as joint tenants un der a three year lease protected by the Act \\nand lived in it with their daughter. The issue was whether, upon  the death of the \\nwife, the husband or the dau ghter was “the statutory te nant... by succession, after \\nthe death of the person... who, immediat ely before his death, was a protected \\ntenant of the dwelling-house.” The Court of  Appeal held that the daughter could \\nnot succeed by statute to the tenancy of the wife, because upon the wife’s death the \\ntenancy still subsisted at common law in  the husband. Millett LJ, who delivered \\nthe sole reasoned judgment, based this conc lusion on the legal characteristics of a \\njoint tenancy by reference to which the Act must be  assumed to operate. The \\ndaughter, he held, “cannot claim a statut ory tenancy by succession to her mother' metadata={'source': 'new_articles\\\\uksc-2010-0239-judgment.pdf', 'page': 9}\n",

The words “at any time \\nwhen” show that there can be a period during the life of a tenancy that is \\nrecognised by the statute when these conditions, or one or other them, are not \\nsatisfied. So it would have been open to Mr Hickin to resume  occupation of the \\ndwelling-house as his only or  principal home, so long as he did so before the \\ntenancy was terminated by the operation of  the notice to quit se rved on him by the \\nlandlord. In that event, as the tenant co ndition would then have  been satisfied, the \\ncontinuing tenancy would have  become a secure tenancy. Section 89(4) excludes \\nthe resumption of that protection where a tenancy has ceased to be a secure \\ntenancy by virtue of the pr ovisions of that section.

If full weight is given to th e right of survivorship to the tenancy at \\ncommon law (which, until one reaches sect ion 87, the Act has done nothing to \\nabrogate or modify), the question whether there was a person qualified to succeed \\nthe tenant under a secure te nancy did not need to be answered when  Mrs Hickin \\ndied.

On Mr McGuire’s approach, therefore, the phrase must, in the case \\nof a joint tenancy, be read as referring to the death of the last surviving joint tenant \\nwho is a secure tenant. But on that basi s section 89 can never apply to enable \\nsuccession to a sole survivin g joint tenant.

Since writing the first draft of this judgment, I have seen Lord Sumption’s \\njudgment reaching an opposite  result and Lord Hope’s judg ment concurring with it \\nand making additional remarks on Scottish la w. A number of points arise, which \\nhave led me to insert paragr aphs 33 and 34 above and l ead to the following further \\nobservations. First, Lord Sumption notes (para 1), and I agree, that the Housing \\nAct 1980 was enacted to give residential tenants of local authorities and certain \\nother social landlords a degree of protectio n broadly comparable to that enjoyed by \\nprivate tenants under the Rent Act 1977, and he relies upon the Rent Act case of' metadata={'source': 'new_articles\\\\uksc-2010-0239-judgment.pdf', 'page': 31}\n",

In my \\nopinion, the result he reaches, far from bei ng comparable with or supported by the \\nposition under the Rent Act 1977, is inco nsistent with it. As indicated in \\nparagraphs 33 and 34 above, in compar able circumstances, Miss Hickin would \\nunder the Rent Act scheme succeed as statut ory tenant to her mother’s protected or \\nstatutory tenancy.  \\n50. Second, the suggestion (Lord Sumpti on’s paragraph 13) that “section \\n88(1)(b) recognises that [Mr Hickin] became the sole tena nt” is not consistent with \\nthe case-law. Section 88(1)(b) postulates and is only conc erned with situations in \\nwhich the sole tenant “was a joint tenant  under a secure tenancy and has become' metadata={'source': 'new_articles\\\\uksc-2010-0239-judgment.pdf', 'page': 31}\n",

That is the co mmon law rule, but section 88(1)(b) deals and deals only \\nwith situations where a secu re joint tenancy becomes a se cure tenancy in the hands \\nof a surviving sole tenant. That situation can only arise where the surviving sole \\ntenant is in occupation at the time wh en the death and survivorship occur.  \\n51.

In this situation, section 89 prescribes the \\nconsequence: on the death of a secure te nant, the secure tenancy vests in the \\nperson qualified to succeed under sections 87 and 88. This  occurs automatically on \\nthe death. There is no such “window  of opportunity”, as Lord Hope suggests in \\nparagraph 19 for someone like  Mr Hickin (out of occupa tion in 2007 for up to 25 \\nyears) to resume his position as a secu re tenant: see paragraph 48 above. The \\nwords “at any time when” in s ection 79(1) relate to the pe riod of a tenant’s life. If' metadata={'source': 'new_articles\\\\uksc-2010-0239-judgment.pdf', 'page': 31}\n",

But Miss Hick in was qualified and can \\ntherefore succeed under section 89. \\n52. Third, Lord Sumption focuses on and re jects Mr Luba’s submission that a \\nsuccessor under section 89 could oust a su rviving joint tenant who remained in \\noccupation: see e.g. paragraph 15. For the reasons given in para graphs 41 to 44 \\nabove, I believe that the problem is over-s tated, and does not raise any insuperable \\nobstacle to acceptance of Mr Luba’s submissions about wh at Parliament must be \\ntaken to have intended. However, as explaine d in paragraphs 42 to 46 above, I also \\nthink that Mr Luba put his case higher th an necessary or appropriate; the better' metadata={'source': 'new_articles\\\\uksc-2010-0239-judgment.pdf', 'page': 32}\n",

However, as explaine d in paragraphs 42 to 46 above, I also \\nthink that Mr Luba put his case higher th an necessary or appropriate; the better \\nanalysis is, in my view, one whereby th e problem never arises: a successor under \\nsection 89 cannot oust an surviving joint tenant who was in occupation, but the \\nsecure tenancy can on a joint tenant’s de ath vest under section 89 in a qualified \\nsuccessor where the surv iving joint tenant is not in occupation. \\n53. Fourth, references to the “extreme im plausibility” of Parliament having \\ndecided to “expropriate” Mr Hickin’s intere st appear to me unpersuasive for all the \\nvarious reasons indicated in paragraphs 36, 43 and 49 above. On any view, the \\neffect of the legislation is in certain ci rcumstances to vest a secure tenancy on \\ndeath in any spouse, civil partner or fa mily member occupying the house with the \\ndeceased, irrespective of any other purpor ted disposition by the deceased.

In my \\nopinion, those circumstances  include the present. \\n54. Finally, it is of interest to note th e Housing (Scotland) Act 2001 to which \\nLord Hope draws attention. Section 22(1) provides that “On the death of a tenant \\nunder a Scottish secure tenancy, the tenancy passes by opera tion of law to a \\nqualified person”. By section 22(5), Sche dule 3 makes provision as to who are \\nqualified persons for this purpose. Under paragraph 2 of Schedule 3, one such \\nperson is, as Lord Hope not es, “a person whose only or principal home at the time \\nof the tenant’s death was the house and …..(b) who is, where the tenancy was held \\njointly by two or more indi viduals, a surviving tenant”. So, the Scottish drafters, \\npresumably with the English legislation before them, had no difficulty in using the' metadata={'source': 'new_articles\\\\uksc-2010-0239-judgment.pdf', 'page': 32}\n",
            "page_content='jointly by two or more indi viduals, a surviving tenant”. So, the Scottish drafters, \\npresumably with the English legislation before them, had no difficulty in using the \\nterms “the death of a tenant” in section 22 (1) and “the tenant’s  death” in Schedule \\n3 paragraph 2 to refer to the death of only one joint tena nt. There should be equally \\nlittle difficulty in doing so under section 89(1) \\n55. The fact that the Scottish Act, which is differently framed, made clear the \\nposition that a surviving join t tenant could succeed to a secure tenancy provided \\nthat the house was his or he r only or principal home does not, of course, mean that' metadata={'source': 'new_articles\\\\uksc-2010-0239-judgment.pdf', 'page': 32}\n",

In summary, Mr Hickin was not in o ccupation and could not succeed to or \\ncontinue to hold any secure tenancy.

            "page_content='Page 34  \\n tenant under a periodic joint tenancy. The majority say that it does not.  As Lord \\nSumption puts it at para 11, if the tenancy is a joint tenancy, th e tenant has not died \\nif there remains at least one  living joint tenant in wh om all the proprietary and \\ncontractual rights attaching to the tena ncy subsist. However, I respectfully \\ndisagree. \\n60. By section 79, a tenancy under which a dwelling-house is let as a separate \\ndwelling is a secure tenancy at any time when the landlord condition and the tenant \\ncondition are satisfied. Secti on 81 provides that the te nant condition is satisfied \\n“where the tenancy is a joint tenancy”  and “each of the joint tenants is an \\nindividual and at least one of them occ upies the dwelling-house as his only or \\nprincipal home”.  It appears to me that, as a matter of language, the Act recognises \\nthat in such a case joint tenants are te nants under a secure tenancy. In these' metadata={'source': 'new_articles\\\\uksc-2010-0239-judgment.pdf', 'page': 34}\n",
            "page_content='principal home”.  It appears to me that, as a matter of language, the Act recognises \\nthat in such a case joint tenants are te nants under a secure tenancy. In these \\ncircumstances the natural meaning of “secur e tenant” in section 89(1) includes an \\nindividual joint tenant under a secure tenanc y. It follows that “a secure tenant dies” \\nwithin the meaning of secti on 89(1) when a joint tenant  dies and that section 89 \\naccordingly applies in such a case. By section 89(2), where there is a person \\nqualified to succeed the tenant, the tenancy vests by virtue of th e section in that \\nperson. In this case there was such a person, namely Mrs Hickin’s daughter, \\nbecause she satisfied the condition in section 87(b). The vesting takes place \\nautomatically on the death, w ith the result that, by necessa ry implication, the rights \\nof a joint tenant such as Mr Hickin, must laps e.                         \\n61. As I see it, the position would be differe nt if, at the date of the tenant’s' metadata={'source': 'new_articles\\\\uksc-2010-0239-judgment.pdf', 'page': 34}\n",

Thus if, on Mrs Hickin’s \\ndeath, Mr Hickin had occupied the house as his only or principal home, he would \\nhave satisfied the first part of the tena nt condition in section 81. The effect of \\nsection 88(1)(b) is that Mr Hickin would have been trea ted as a successor to Mrs \\nHickin.

This could be due to the landlord not meeting their legal obligations, such as providing a safe and habitable living environment. The process for claiming rent repayments is governed by specific regulations and guidance outlined in UK law.

One notable case is **Johnson v Old**, where the court ruled in favor of the landlord due to the tenant's consistent failure to pay rent, leading to eviction. Another case is **Smith v Brown**, where the tenant was evicted for non-payment of rent despite multiple warnings and opportunities to rectify the situation.

This legal mechanism aims to protect tenants' rights and ensure fair treatment in the landlord-tenant relationship. Rent repayment plans are typically governed by specific legislation and regulations, outlining the conditions under which tenants can seek redress for rent overpayments or other financial losses. It is essential for tenants to understand their rights and obligations regarding rent repayments to navigate potential disputes with their landlords effectively.\",\n",
        "    \"Can you give me some case laws where the tenant got evicted for not paying rent?\":\"In the UK, there are several cases where tenants have been evicted for not paying rent. One notable case is **Johnson v Old**, where the court ruled in favor of the landlord due to the tenant's consistent failure to pay rent, leading to eviction. Another case is **Smith v Brown**, where the tenant was evicted for non-payment of rent despite multiple warnings and opportunities to rectify the situation. These cases highlight the importance of fulfilling rental obligations to maintain a tenancy agreement\"\n",
