      "answer": "Tenants in the UK have the right to live in a property that's safe and in a good state of repair, have their deposit returned at the end of the tenancy, challenge excessively high charges, and know who their landlord is. This information is based on the Housing Act 1988 and the Landlord and Tenant Act 1985."

      "question": "How much notice does my landlord have to give to increase rent?",
      "answer": "For periodic tenancies (rolling on a week-by-week or month-by-month basis), your landlord must give you notice of rent increase at least one month. For fixed-term tenancies, the notice period depends on the terms of your tenancy agreement. This is guided by the Landlord and Tenant Act 1985."
